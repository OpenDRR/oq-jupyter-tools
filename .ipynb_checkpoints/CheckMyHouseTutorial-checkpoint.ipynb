    "**Learning Objective**: The goal of this tutorial is to help a new user understand how OpenQuake works, by using it to calculate the probability of damage to their house from a scenario earthquake. You will practice building an exposure file for your house, and learn what other files are required to run a calculation in OQ. Just follow along and be sure to hit 'run' on each code snippet, unless stated otherwise. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation [Pinho, 2012, Crowley et al., 2013], OQ is a free, open-source, community-developed code to assess seismic hazard and risk globally [see Monelli et al., 2012, Pagani et al., 2014, Silva et al., 2014]. Natural Resources Canada has been a proud public partner of GEM since 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, OpenQuake allows you to find out how an earthquake (or catalogue of earthquakes) would impact buildings and people. For this exercise, we'll simplify it down to a single earthquake and a single building of interest: your house! \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/h2kaUZAxx7y9uYPJfS/giphy.gif \"We need to be prepared.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this calculation, we will need to feed OQ some information about:\n",
    "* **The Earthquake**    \n",
    "    Where is it? How strong is it? We'll call this the _rupture_. Because earthquakes shaking is stronger near the epicenter, we also need to consider how strongly the quake will be felt at your house. This is based on properties of the earth's crust, and will be described by Ground Motion Prediction Equations or _GMPE's_ that relate the size of an earthquake to the shaking you would feel, depending on your soil conditions. The intensity of shaking is referred to as the _seismic hazard_.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **People & Places**     \n",
    "    How many people may be in harm's way? Which buildings? We'll describe the occupants and the specifics of the building in what's called an _exposure_ file.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Their Susceptibility**    \n",
    "    Is my house strong enough to withstand the shaking? How was it constructed? We'll describe the strength of the buildings in terms of their fragility and vulnerability. _Fragility_ is the relationship between how much the building is shaken and the likelihood of being in different states of damage. _Vulnerability_ is the relationship between shaking and the expected loss, expressed in dollars. We'll come back to this one in a future tutorial.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ASQmEVV.png \"A schematic showing the relationship between an earthquake, the exposed assets, and the ground motion prediction equations.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know all of those things, then we can use OpenQuake to calculate the probability of your home being in a certain damage state after the scenario earthquake. We will also talk a little bit about visualizing the outputs, using QGIS or matplotlib. These are fundamental skills for data scientists, engineers, and policy analysts. "

    "What damage state is your building in? Let's download the results in two ways. First, we will obtain the average results per asset (your house). This is the average number of buildings in each damage state, over all of the realizations we considered. In this case, it's like a probability of being in each damage state: none, slight, moderate, extensive, and complete. These damage states are described in detail in [this HAZUS Manual appendix](https://www.eeri.org/wp-content/uploads/Appendix-2-HAZUS-Damage-States.pdf). For reference, here it the description for a W1 building:    \n",
    "\n",
    "   * __Slight Damage__: Small plaster or gypsum-board cracks at corners of door and window openings and wall-ceiling intersections; small cracks in masonry chimneys and masonry veneer.    \n",
    "   * __Moderate Damage__: Large plaster or gypsum-board cracks at corners of door and window openings; small diagonal cracks across shear wall panels exhibited by small cracks in stucco and gypsum wall panels; large cracks in brick chimneys; toppling of tall masonry chimneys.     \n",
    "   * __Extensive Damage__: Large diagonal cracks across shear wall panels or large cracks at plywood joints; permanent lateral movement of floors and roof; toppling of most brick chimneys; cracks in foundations; splitting of wood sill plates and/or slippage of structure over foundations; partial collapse of “room-over-garage” or other “soft-story” configurations; small foundations cracks.     \n",
    "   * __Complete Damage__: Structure may have large permanent lateral displacement, may collapse, or be in imminent danger of collapse due to cripple wall failure or the failure of the lateral load resisting system; some structures may slip and fall off the foundations; large foundation cracks. Approximately 3% of the total area of W1 buildings with Complete damage is expected to be collapsed. "
