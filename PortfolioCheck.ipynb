    "What damage state is your building in? Let's download the results in two ways. First, we will obtain the average results per asset (your house). This is the average number of buildings in each damage state, over all of the realizations we considered. In this case, it's like a probability of being in each damage state: none, slight, moderate, extensive, and complete. These damage states are described in detail in [this HAZUS Manual appendix](https://www.eeri.org/wp-content/uploads/Appendix-2-HAZUS-Damage-States.pdf). For reference, here it the description for a W1 building:    \n",
    "\n",
    "   * __Slight Damage__: Small plaster or gypsum-board cracks at corners of door and window openings and wall-ceiling intersections; small cracks in masonry chimneys and masonry veneer.    \n",
    "   * __Moderate Damage__: Large plaster or gypsum-board cracks at corners of door and window openings; small diagonal cracks across shear wall panels exhibited by small cracks in stucco and gypsum wall panels; large cracks in brick chimneys; toppling of tall masonry chimneys.     \n",
    "   * __Extensive Damage__: Large diagonal cracks across shear wall panels or large cracks at plywood joints; permanent lateral movement of floors and roof; toppling of most brick chimneys; cracks in foundations; splitting of wood sill plates and/or slippage of structure over foundations; partial collapse of “room-over-garage” or other “soft-story” configurations; small foundations cracks.     \n",
    "   * __Complete Damage__: Structure may have large permanent lateral displacement, may collapse, or be in imminent danger of collapse due to cripple wall failure or the failure of the lateral load resisting system; some structures may slip and fall off the foundations; large foundation cracks. Approximately 3% of the total area of W1 buildings with Complete damage is expected to be collapsed. "
